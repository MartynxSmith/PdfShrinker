# PdfShrinker
We needed a very simple way for staff to compress their PDF documents down so they could be sent via email.
Adobe Distiller was overkill, and other tools involved too many steps or required the original documents to
be modified. So to meet their needs I quickly put this small tool together.

This application uses [Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com) to handle the compression. You will need to have a version
installed in order to use this tool. If you already use [PDF Creator](http://www.pdfforge.org/pdfcreator) or 
[CutePDF](http://www.cutepdf.com/) then GhostScript is probably already installed.

For Word and Publisher files the [Office Interop libaries](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/15s06t57.aspx) are used
to automate those applications to save your documents as PDFs before compressing them.

## Usage

Simply drag some PDF or Word or Publisher files you'd like compressed to PDF and it will spit out 
compressed versions in the same directory as the originals.

Or choose to overwrite the orginal files and or keep the original modified dates. See below:

You can also press the *Open* button to browse for files using the regular Open File Dialog.

## Requirements
You'll need Ghostscript installed. If you don't have a copy it can be downlaoded from 
https://www.ghostscript.com/download/gsdnld.html

To convert Word and Publisher files you'll Microsoft Word and/or Publisher installed on your PC. 
Trial versions are available from https://products.office.com/en-au/try.
